# CMP 464 – Full Stack Web Development

[Department of Computer Science](http://lehman.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/index.php), Lehman College  
Spring, 2023

**Instructor:** Cameron Flowers  
**Lecture:** Mondays & Wednesdays 6:00-7:40 p.m.  
**Grading:** Letter Grade

## Rationale

The professional landscape for engineers requires students to demonstrate a number of applied skills in technology, design, and management. In this course, students will be immersed in a professional engineering environment through rigorous project based work across the full stack and cloud environments. Students will build dynamic full-stack applications utilizing current industry-preferred frameworks and modules while learning best practices in project management, version control, and continuous integration.

## Course Aims and Outcomes

### Aims

As a result of participating in this course, students will be able to more fully understand the architecture of production ready applications, demonstrate proficiency in full stack and cloud native development, and the professional workflows of leading engineering teams.

### Specific Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be well-versed in the workflows required for production ready applications and engineering teams. Students will be able to develop functional “full stack” web applications and discuss the benefits of various architectures, design patterns, and elements of production-readyness in groups. They will be introduced to concepts across the full-stack architecture including front end design and development with HTML/CSS and Javascript as well as back end development with a variety of languages including Java, Javascript and Python. The course will then introduce back-end web application concepts such as databases, application servers and cloud based hosting. Students will also learn Agile Development and project management workflows, and build production ready applications in small groups structured as real engineering teams.

## Format and Procedures

This course meets twice a week. This course is intended to reflect industry norms as much as possible; to that end, project delivery and collaboration are emphasized over homework and written assessments.

## Assumptions

This course has no prerequisite courses; however, students are expected to be proficient in general programming principles and able to code in at least one language. Such experience will ensure that students are able to expediently learn new programming languages as they are introduced in this course.

No web development experience is required; this course assumes that students do not have any prior knowledge of the subject matter.

## Course Requirements

Tasks and assignments are intended to align with the learning outcomes specified above.

### Class attendance

**Attendance is a graded component of this class**, and students are required to attend all lectures to fully benefit from the delivered material and peer discussion.

### Course readings

In adhering to "real-world" industry norms, this class does not have any required texts, as all course material can be obtained through various free online resources. However, various readings will be recommended during the course of this class and will likely be helpful to student learning.

## Academic Integrity

This course observed and upholds the [CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/about/policies_pdf/CUNYAcademicIntegrityPolicy.pdf) ([Accessible Plain Text](http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/about/policies_pdf/CUNYAcademicIntegrityPolicy.txt)). Each student in this course is expected to abide by this policy. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. Collaboration is allowed where assignments are designated as group projects.

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

## Reasonable Accommodations and Academic Adjustments

In compliance with [CUNY policy](http://www2.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-procedures/reasonable-accommodations-and-academic-adjustments/) ([PDF](http://www2.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-procedures/reasonable-accommodations-and-academic-adjustments/Procedures-for-Implementing-Reasonable-Accommodations-9.21.2016.pdf)) and equal access laws, I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be required for student with disabilities.

## Inclusivity Statement

We understand that our members represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. The Computer Science department is committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community we ask all members to:

- share their unique experiences, values and beliefs
- be open to the views of others
- honor the uniqueness of their colleagues
- appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community
- value each other's opinions and communicate in a respectful manner
- keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature
- use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in this course and across the CUNY community
